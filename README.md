When it comes to health, every human being has their own definition. While some say, that the best way to a healthy life is good food others tend to disagree
as they believe exercises keep us in good condition. Although I think both exercises and diet goes hand-in-hand, in some cases exercises has a small edge on
diet. In this essay, I will put forward my views on both points and try to prove why exercises has an edge.

On one hand, food is one of the three basic necessities of living beings. Even WHO (World Health Organisation) has suggested that a person should include five
portions of fruits and vegetables in their daily diet which provides balance. 

But on the other hand, advocates of exercies will argue that exercises are essential towards good health. Engaging in exercises helps a person stay in a 
specific weight range and keeps body away from diseases like diabaties, obeasity, heart diseases, etc. Regular exercises fosters better sleep pattern
with increase in muscular strength. Exercises also have a direct relation to mental health as daily exercises reduces stress and prompting a sence of achievement.
