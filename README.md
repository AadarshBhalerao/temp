Some people think that success is the best measure for intelligence, while others think that intelligence can be measured in other ways

There are people who believe that intelligence of a person is directly incured from their success and then there are others who think there are different ways to measure intelligence.In my opinion, not every intelligent person becomes successful and vice versa. Since intelligence is a very subjective topic, there should be no scale to measure intelligence and should be allowed to be measured by different ways. Below I have mentioned reasons why.

For example, if a teacher who runs a tution batch of 20 students and every year almost all of their childern score excellent marks in examinations indicates that even though they run a small batch they may not be as successful when compared to the multimillion dollar industrial coaching classes however their intelligence has driven the academics of the 20 students
